1. Created script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:


The ticker symbol.


Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The total stock volume of the stock.




2. Created conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

3. Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

4. Run script on every worksheet i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
